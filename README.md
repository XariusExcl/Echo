# Echo 
Lost at the bottom of the abyss, only your dear radar can keep you alive.

You are attacked by enemy submarines.
Using your radar, anticipate their actions and catch them off guard to survive as long as possible.

**Controls :**

Echo is played exclusively with the mouse.

Clicking on "move" will allow you to give a course to your submarine by orienting it on the radar.

Clicking on "Fire" allows you to direct a torpedo fire by interacting with the radar. 

Clicking on "Cntr" (Countermeasures) protects your submarine from any torpedoes that threaten to kill you for the next 4 seconds. Be careful, you can only send them once every 20 seconds.
